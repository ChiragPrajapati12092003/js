## javascript and classes 



Yes, JavaScript does have classes, although the way classes are implemented in JavaScript might differ from classical object-oriented languages like Java or C++.

Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which is also known as ECMAScript 2015. Classes in JavaScript provide syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model. They allow you to define blueprints for creating objects with a shared set of properties and methods.
